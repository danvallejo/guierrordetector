To keep a Graphical User Interface (GUI) responsive and active, a GUI
application often has a main \textit{UI thread} (or \textit{event dispatching thread})
and spawns separate threads to handle lengthy operations in the background,
such as expensive computation, I/O tasks, and network requests.
Many GUI frameworks require all GUI objects to be accessed exclusively by the
UI thread. If a GUI object is accessed through a non-UI thread,
an \textit{invalid thread access} error occurs and the whole
application may abort. 

This paper presents a general technique to find such \textit{invalid thread access}
errors in multithreaded GUI applications. We formulate finding invalid
thread access errors as a call graph reachability problem with
thread spawning as the sources and GUI object accessing as the sinks. 
Heavy use of reflection in modern GUI applications makes existing
call graph construction algorithms fail to build a sufficiently complete
and precise call graph. Thus, we present a combined RTA and k-CFA
call graph construction algorithm to overcome the limitations.% of analyzing GUI applications.


We implemented our technique and instantiated it on four popular GUI
platforms: SWT, Eclipse plugin development framework, Java Swing, and
Android. In an evaluation on XX subjects over XXX LOC, our technique
found a number of real-world errors, suggesting its effectiveness
and showing good scalability.
